// Generated with cargo new
// To build using that: cargo build > creates 'cargo.lock' file and '/target', '/target/debug' folders
// 'cargo run' command will build and run executable file.
// 'cargo check' this command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable
// 'cargo build --release' compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release
